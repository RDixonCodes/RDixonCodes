- ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Rickie Dixon, a full-stack web developer with a unique combination of technical proficiency, strong customer service skills, and a background in architectural design. I'm known for my problem-solving abilities and my passion for crafting technology solutions that positively benefit users. Beyond coding, my interests include architecture and skateboarding. I pursued architecture at the University of South Florida's School of Architecture and Community Design before transitioning to coding. One of my favorite architects is Santiago Calatrava, as I admire how his structures seamlessly blend precise engineering with a tasteful touch of artistic balance.
  
- I'm continuously expanding my knowledge base by diving into various technologies, but recently, my focus has been on delving deeper into React and its associated libraries. It's been an enjoyable experience exploring the capabilities of these tools and discovering how they can be effectively integrated and leveraged in different contexts.
