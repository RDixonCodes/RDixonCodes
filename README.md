- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Rickie Dixon. I'm a full-stack web developer with a distinctive blend of technical skills, customer service expertise, and an architectural design background. Recognized for innovative problem-solving and a passion for creating tech solutions that have a positive impact on users. Besides coding my other interest are architecture and skateboarding. Before coding I was in the architecture program at the University of South Florida. One of my favorite architects is Santiago Calatrava. His structures combine precise engineering with a tasteful touch of artistic balance.
  
- Iâ€™m currently learning whatever I can get my hands on, but lately I've been diving deeper into React and it's associated libraries. It has been fun seeing what all these different tools can do and how they can be used in different ways with each other.
